## Intro

The list is defined by Hugo and Nicolas to promote the exchangeability of our VM files generated by our compilers, following the protocols introduced in the courses.

Meanwhile, **the list is subject to changes**. When adding new functions to the processor, we will append the functions to the end of the list, and increase the minor version number. And for each modification on existing function, we would update a major version number.

Simply pull a request to add your name in the **FOLLOWER** section to comply with this so-called standard.

Happy coding.
